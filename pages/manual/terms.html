        <p>Here are some common terms used in <strong>manual testing</strong>, which is the process of testing software manually by executing test cases without the help of automation tools:</p>
<h3 id="1-test-case">1. <strong>Test Case</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A test case is a specific set of actions or conditions used to verify a particular aspect of the software. It includes a set of input conditions, execution steps, and expected results.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A test case for logging into an application could include steps like entering the username and password, then verifying whether the user is redirected to the homepage upon successful login.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-test-plan">2. <strong>Test Plan</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A test plan is a detailed document that outlines the strategy, scope, approach, resources, schedule, and objectives of the testing effort. It provides an overview of the testing process.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A test plan may specify the testing objectives, such as validating the functionality of a shopping cart, and define the types of testing (functional, regression, etc.) to be conducted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-test-suite">3. <strong>Test Suite</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A test suite is a collection of related test cases grouped together to test a particular feature or functionality of the software.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A test suite for an e-commerce website might include test cases for user registration, login, browsing products, adding to the cart, and making payments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-bugdefect">4. <strong>Bug/Defect</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A bug (or defect) is an issue or error found in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. Bugs are typically documented and tracked for resolution.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A bug could occur when a &quot;Submit&quot; button on a form doesnâ€™t trigger the expected action, like submitting data.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-regression-testing">5. <strong>Regression Testing</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Regression testing involves re-running previously executed test cases to ensure that new changes, such as bug fixes or feature additions, have not introduced new issues or affected existing functionality.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: After fixing a bug in the login functionality, regression testing would verify that the login, as well as other areas of the software, still works correctly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-smoke-testing">6. <strong>Smoke Testing</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Smoke testing, also known as &quot;build verification testing,&quot; is a preliminary testing phase to check if the major functions of the software work. It ensures the software build is stable enough for further testing.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: After receiving a new build, a tester might verify that the application starts and key features like login and basic navigation are functioning before proceeding to more detailed testing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-sanity-testing">7. <strong>Sanity Testing</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Sanity testing is a quick, shallow testing process used to verify that specific functionality or bug fixes are working as expected. It is narrower in scope than full regression testing.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: After a bug fix is applied to the login feature, sanity testing would check if the fix works and that the login functionality behaves correctly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-ad-hoc-testing">8. <strong>Ad-hoc Testing</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Ad-hoc testing is an informal type of testing where the tester explores the application without any predefined test cases. The aim is to discover defects by randomly testing the application.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A tester might click through various sections of a web app to see if they can find any unexpected issues or crashes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="9-exploratory-testing">9. <strong>Exploratory Testing</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Exploratory testing is an unscripted, simultaneous learning and testing process, where testers actively explore the application to understand its functionality and look for defects, while adapting their testing approach based on findings.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A tester might test a new feature by using it as an end-user would, without predefined test cases, while simultaneously learning how the feature works.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="10-user-acceptance-testing-uat">10. <strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final testing phase where actual users validate the software to ensure it meets their needs and requirements before release.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: In an e-commerce application, UAT could involve users checking if they can complete tasks like browsing products, adding them to the cart, and completing a purchase.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="11-test-environment">11. <strong>Test Environment</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A test environment is a setup of hardware, software, and network configurations where the testing is executed. It mimics the production environment.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: For testing a mobile app, the test environment might include specific mobile devices, OS versions, and network conditions to simulate real-world usage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="12-defect-life-cycle-bug-life-cycle">12. <strong>Defect Life Cycle (Bug Life Cycle)</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: The defect life cycle represents the journey of a bug from detection to resolution. It defines the different states a defect goes through during the testing process.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A defect might start in the &quot;New&quot; state, move to &quot;Assigned&quot; to a developer, change to &quot;Fixed,&quot; and then undergo &quot;Retesting&quot; before being marked as &quot;Closed&quot; if resolved successfully.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="13-boundary-value-analysis">13. <strong>Boundary Value Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a testing technique that focuses on testing the boundaries of input data values. It is based on the premise that errors often occur at the boundaries rather than in the middle of the input range.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: For a form field that accepts numbers from 1 to 100, boundary value testing would include values like 0, 1, 100, and 101 to test how the system handles inputs at the edges of the range.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="14-test-report">14. <strong>Test Report</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: A test report is a document that provides detailed information about the testing process, including the test cases executed, the results, defects found, and the overall status of testing.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: After completing the testing of a software release, a test report may summarize which features were tested, which bugs were found, and whether the software is ready for release.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="15-priority-and-severity">15. <strong>Priority and Severity</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority</strong>: Refers to how quickly a bug should be fixed based on business impact and urgency.</li>
<li><strong>Severity</strong>: Refers to the seriousness of the bug and its impact on the functionality of the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug that causes the application to crash might be <strong>high severity</strong>, but if it only happens during a rare scenario, it might be of <strong>low priority</strong>.</li>
<li>A typo in the footer of a website might have <strong>low severity</strong> but <strong>high priority</strong> if it affects a major marketing campaign.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="16-test-execution">16. <strong>Test Execution</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Test execution is the process of running the test cases on the software to validate its functionality.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: A tester manually follows the steps outlined in the test cases, inputs the specified data, and records the actual outcome of the test to compare with the expected results.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="17-test-data">17. <strong>Test Data</strong></h3>
<p>   <strong>Definition</strong>: Test data refers to the data used during test execution to evaluate the behavior of the software. It can be valid or invalid, depending on what is being tested.</p>
<p>   <strong>Example</strong>: For a login feature, valid test data might include correct username and password, while invalid test data could be incorrect credentials.</p>
<hr>
<p>These terms represent just a fraction of the terminology in manual testing, but they cover some of the most important aspects of the process used to validate the functionality, quality, and reliability of software applications.</p>
