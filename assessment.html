        <p><strong>Question:</strong><br>What is the main difference between <em>smoke testing</em> and <em>regression
                testing</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer Choices:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Smoke testing is conducted to ensure that core functions work, while regression testing is performed
                to confirm that recent code changes haven’t affected existing features.</li>
            <li>B. Smoke testing is a thorough examination of the entire software, while regression testing only checks
                a few features.</li>
            <li>C. Smoke testing only happens in the production environment, while regression testing is performed in
                both staging and production.</li>
            <li>D. Smoke testing and regression testing are essentially the same and can be used interchangeably.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong><br>You are testing a calculator app. You notice that when you enter
            <code>2 + 2</code>, the result displayed is <code>4.0</code> instead of <code>4</code>. The requirement
            states the app should return integer results for integer inputs. What would you report?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer Choices:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. No issue; <code>4.0</code> and <code>4</code> are equivalent.</li>
            <li>B. Minor defect; the app should return <code>4</code> as an integer, not <code>4.0</code>.</li>
            <li>C. Major defect; the app calculation is incorrect.</li>
            <li>D. Enhancement; it would be nice to have <code>4</code> as an integer, but it&#39;s not necessary.</li>
